              Excel Data Cleaning Practice
This Excel file is part of my personal data cleaning and analysis practice.     
It includes raw data, cleaned data,formulas, conditional formatting, pivot tables, and a dashboard created for learning process.
I using formulas to calculate count and average values. I applied conditional formatting to highlight important data patterns and errors.
Pivot tables were created to summarize sale item by quantity and price and slicers were used for quick filtering.Finally, I designed an interactive dashboard with charts to visualize total sales,quantity.
Some blanks are still present because the raw dataset had missing quantity and price values-kept intentionally as part of my practice and understanding of real-world data issues.
